        The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated subspecies of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red junglefowl</a> 
        (Gallus gallus), originally native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around 8,000
        years ago and is now one of the most common and widespread domesticated animals in the world.
        Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and eggs, though they are also kept as pets.[1]
